It also caused us to lose agility and safety but only so much that it was no longer ideal.  It still met all minimum standards of the consultants.  This leads me to think that our best route is to ideally forget about higher ROMs, even 4 was putting unnecessary constraints on our prototypes.

The change in battery from NiCd to LiPo allowed for a much higher payload for about 60 dollars less and gave us maybe 24 minutes of extra use before needing a recharge. It also caused us to lose agility and safety but only so much that it was no longer ideal. It still met all minimum standards of the consultants. This leads me to think that our best route is to ideally forget about higher ROMs, even 4 was putting unnecessary constraints on our prototypes.

1835,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:05,14,5,Second,36,I think it's too bad that we don't get to make a final one to test if we could I'd rather test more with the composite material,1835,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
1836,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:06,14,5,Second,36,I think that we should avoid using the steel as it slowed down the skeleton and made it far less safe,1836,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1
1837,kevin g,FirstGame,5,6,1,Low.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:08,14,5,Second,36,And its payload is still pretty low,1837,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
1838,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:09,14,5,Second,36,I agree that the cost is a issue although it still falls far within the marketing requests and I think if we combined it with the Pneumatic actuator instead of the electric it would also fall within the environmental requests,1838,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
1839,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:09,14,5,Second,36,payload seems to be our biggest problem,1839,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
1840,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:10,14,5,Second,36,we had initially agreed to avoid steel as much as possible yet it seems that features other than material had very little effect on payload,1840,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
1841,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:13,14,5,Second,36,@Nassim Tehrani: We have yet to make that decision although we are doing our best to find a prototype that falls within all of the requested performance levels,1841,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

1843,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:14,14,5,Second,36,On our initial graphs it is shown that strain guage sensors show a much lower payload than piezoelectric yet when we tested these (changing only these) on our pneumatic actuator the same payload resulted.,1843,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
1844,kevin g,FirstGame,5,6,1,Low.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:14,14,5,Second,36,I think that payload is the greatest weakness of our two actuators so we almost have to choose Steel,1844,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
1845,joseph k,FirstGame,6,8,2,High.Pre,Pos.Change,Pos.Change,10/22/2013 10:17,14,5,Second,36,I have a final model that has a payload of 528 agility of 254 interval of 6.85 cost of 12740 and saftey of 197 we could use this one it had ROM 4,1845,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1

1849,connor f,FirstGame,6,6,0,High.Pre,No.Change,Neg.Change,10/22/2013 10:20,14,5,Second,36,The hydraulic prototypes had much better payloads,1849,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1
